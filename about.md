## About Me

I am a researcher and Software Quality Engineer at Cloud Connect, situated at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Software Assurance**. My work investigates how cutting-edge AI methodologies can be synthesized with traditional testing frameworks to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the modern software development lifecycle.

## Research Focus & Proficiencies

With over 7 years in software engineering and 4 years dedicated to **Network Security Research**, I leverage a keen analytical eye to deconstruct complex systems and identify structural vulnerabilities. My expertise lies in bridge the gap between theoretical security research and practical quality engineering:

- **AI-Driven Quality Assurance**: Investigating LLM-based test generation and automated heuristic evaluation.
- **Systemic Vulnerability Analysis**: Identifying and mitigating critical defects through rigorous experimental methodologies.
- **Security Protocols**: Applying research-grade analysis to secure distributed systems and web architectures.

## Research Interests

My current investigations focus on the dynamic interplay between autonomous systems and software stability:

- **AI Exploration**: Generative models for automated test synthesis.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Incorporating predictive analytics into deployment pipelines.
- **Code Assessment**: Formal benchmarks for evaluating security and code quality.
- **Test Automation**: Researching self-healing test architectures.
- **Web Application Security**: Investigating emerging threats in cloud-native environments.
